* How would you handle problems? 

  * You get paged (means some critical functionality is down/unusable for customers) at 3 AM and have 0 clue on what happened, and you cannot find the solution for >1 hour, tomorrow morning is an important meeting you need to attend at 10 

    * Maybe pull someone in, escalate to second level of on-call 
    * Meeting probably needs to be moved or if not possible, you need to ask someone else to join the meeting instead 
    * Document your findings and the solution thoroughly as soon as a solution is found
